## Executive Summary

**testcontainers-go fixtures, FHIR synthetic test data, and integration test utilities.**

This document defines the **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** scope for `zs-pkg-go-testing` within the ZarishSphere sovereign digital health platform. It covers what must be built first, acceptance criteria, user stories, and the complete repository file structure.


### Platform Non-Negotiables (apply to every repository)

| Constraint | Rule |
|-----------|------|
| **Zero Cost** | All tooling, hosting, and services must use genuinely free tiers |
| **Open Source** | Apache 2.0 license; all code public |
| **FHIR R5 Native** | All clinical data modelled as FHIR R5 resources |
| **Offline-First** | Must function without network connectivity |
| **No-Coder Friendly** | GUI-first, template-driven, automatable |
| **Documentation as Code** | All decisions in GitHub via RFC/ADR |
| **Multi-tenant** | tenant_id scoping on all data operations |
| **HIPAA/GDPR** | AuditEvent on all PHI access; field-level encryption |

---

## Problem Statement

testcontainers-go fixtures, FHIR synthetic test data, and integration test utilities.

## MVP Goals

1. Export a stable, documented public API
2. Achieve >80% unit test coverage
3. Zero external dependencies beyond what is absolutely necessary
4. Provide usage examples for all major exported symbols
5. Publish as an importable Go module

## MVP Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement | Acceptance Criteria | Priority |
|----|------------|---------------------|---------|
| M-01 | Exported types compile without error | `go build ./...` succeeds | P0 |
| M-02 | Unit tests pass with race detector | `go test -race ./...` passes | P0 |
| M-03 | GoDoc on all exported symbols | `godoc` shows documentation | P0 |
| M-04 | Example usage in `examples/` or `_test.go` | Example compiles and runs | P1 |
| M-05 | Semantic versioning via release workflow | `v1.0.0` tag triggers CHANGELOG | P1 |

## Exported API (MVP)

### Types
- `PostgreSQLFixture struct`
- `NATSFixture struct`
- `FHIRTestData struct`

### Functions
- `NewPostgreSQLFixture(ctx context.Context, migrationPath string) (*PostgreSQLFixture, error)`
- `NewNATSFixture(ctx context.Context) (*NATSFixture, error)`
- `SyntheticPatient(tenantID string) *fhir.Patient`
- `SyntheticEncounter(patientID, tenantID string) *fhir.Encounter`
